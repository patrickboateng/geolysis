    The Unified Soil Classification System, initially developed by Casagrande
    in 1948 and later modified in 1952, is widely utilized in engineering
    projects involving soils. It is the most popular system for soil
    classification and is similar to Casagrande's Classification System. The
    system relies on particle size analysis and atterberg limits for
    classification.

    In this system, soils are first classified into two categories:

    - Coarse grained soils: If more than 50% of the soils is retained on
      No. 200 (0.075 mm) sieve, it is designated as coarse-grained soil.

    - Fine grained soils: If more than 50% of the soil passes through No. 200
      sieve, it is designated as fine-grained soil.

    Highly Organic soils are identified by visual inspection. These soils are
