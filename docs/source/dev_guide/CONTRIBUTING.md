### Development process - summary

If you want to contribute code to the project, please follow
these steps:

1. If you are a first time contributor:

   - Go to <https://github.com/patrickboateng/geolysis> and fork the repository
     to your own GitHub account.

   - Clone the project to your local computer:

     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/geolysis.git
     ```

   - Move into the `geolysis` directory or the directory you saved the project
     to:

     ```sh
     cd geolysis
     ```

   - Add the upstream repository:

     ```sh
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/patrickboateng/geolysis.git
     ```

   - Now, `git remote -v` will show two remote repositories named:

     - `upstream`, which refers to the `geolysis` repository
     - `origin`, which refers to your personal fork

   - Pull the latest changes from upstream, including tags:

     ```sh
     git checkout main
     git pull upstream main --tags
     ```

1. Develop your contribution:

   - This project uses `pipenv` for dependency management so make sure you have
     it installed on your system.

   - Run `pipenv install` to install all project dependencies.

   - Run `make test` to confirm all tests are passing before you start
     making changes. Check out the [testing](#testing) section for more
     information.

   - Create a branch for your contribution. Kindly use a descriptive name since
     the branch name will appear in the merge message.

     ```sh
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```

   - Make your changes, following the [style guide](./style_guide.rst).
     _Kindly read the style guide before contributing code to the `geolysis`
     project_.

   - Commit locally as you progress (`git add` and `git commit`). Use a
     [properly formatted](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) commit message, write
     tests that fail before your change and pass afterward (both new and
     existing tests), run all [tests locally](#testing). Be sure to document any
     changed behavior in docstrings, keeping to the
     [style guide](style_guide.rst#code-documentation).

1. To submit your contribution:

   - Push your changes back to your fork on `GitHub`.

     ```sh
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```

   - Go to GitHub, the new branch will show up with a green Pull request button.
     Make sure the title and message are clear, concise, and self-explanatory.
     Click the button to submit it.

1. Review process:

   - Respond to any feedback or questions from reviewers.
   - To update your Pull Request (PR), make your changes on your local
     repository, commit, run tests, and only if they pass should you push to
     your fork on GitHub. As soon as those changes are pushed up (to the same
     branch as before) the PR will update automatically. If you have no idea how
     to fix the test failures, you may push your changes any way and ask for
     help in a PR comment.
   - A PR must be approved by at least one core member before merging. Approval
     means the core team member has carefully reviewed the changes, and the PR
     is ready for merging.

## Testing

Running geolysis test suite locally requires some additional packages, such as
[pytest](https://pytest.org/) and
[coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.3.2/) will automatically
install if you run `pipenv install`

- To run the tests, run the following command below:

  ```sh
  make test
  ```

- To measure the test coverage, run:

  ```sh
  make testcov
  ```

- To view test coverage report, run:

  ```sh
  make testreport
  ```

  **_This command works only after `make testcov` has been successfully run._**

- For a nicer presentation, use `make testreporthtml` to get annotated HTML
  listings detailing missed lines:

  ```sh
  make testreporthtml
  ```

  Then open **htmlcov/index.html** in your browser, to see view the report.

Improvements to documentation are always appreciated. If you make changes to the
code, please update the documentation as needed. See [style guide](style_guide.rst)
